                        <p>In order to build the tip complex, the T3SS has a needle filament that is thought to act as a construction scaffold. This puts 5 tip protein subunits into the correct arrangement for them to self-assemble. To create the tip complex artificially, we’re building the world’s smallest construction scaffolds from DNA. These were designed to mimic the T3SS needle filament that could be chemically functionalised with 5 protein binding sites with the correct spatial arrangement.</p>

                        <p>The linear scaffold is a 50 base pair length single-stranded DNA template. Primarily used in Blitz, it contains three different ‘domains’ with which function is changed. The 5 prime end is modified with biotin for attachment to a streptavidin surface. A central binding domain consisting of 10 base pairs allows attachment to a complementary modified strand in the middle of the template. The modification was chosen depending on the test used, such as a 5 prime Tris Aminated modification for protein to DNA conjugation. 20 base pairs either side are non-complementary to any other strands, and are thus termed non-binding.</p>

                        <p>NUPACK algorithim; Nucleic acid sequence design via efficient ensemble defect optimization was utilised in designing a ‘tennis racquet’ like flat DNA design. The racquet was ordered such that the 5’ end was biotinylated, allowing for conjugation to a streptavidin surface. Ten base pair single stranded DNA (ssDNA) was ordered with complementary sequence to the binding domain. This ten base pair ssDNA is the conjugating strand and was made with to be 5’ or 3’ Tris Aminated. (Check out <a href="labbook_conjugation.html">Conjugation Chemistry</a> to find out more). Here’s our NUPACK code! </p>

                                                    <p>DNA barrels have previously been made with single walls. We designed barrels with a puckered wall to appropriate the structure’s end to the size required by the tip complex.</p> 
                        <p>Initially, staple crossovers and potential crossover sites for each barrel were designed using an algorithm by our team. Our problem poses a significant design challenge, as the T3SS tip complex has an odd numbered rotational symmetry. Puckered walls allow both odd numbered rotational symmetry, but also smaller diameters, which is perfect for our miniscule tip complex!</p>
                        <p>The hanging M13 scaffold (of which approximately 180 base pairs exists) was made to hang from the centre of a beta barrel. It was placed here to position it in the most unlikely location for interaction with either end of the barrel.</p>
                        <p>Here’s what the barrel should look like from one of its ends:</p>

                        <p>CaDNAno was used to draw out the crossovers for our <a href="images/dnadesignPuckered10merjson.json">puckered design</a> and thread them over the M13 scaffold strand. Once all staples for the body of the barrel had been drawn out with the correct crossovers, our staple ends were designed.</p>

                        <p>We designed "adaptor" oligos to replace the very end staples of each helix which have a 'staple' domain that is complimentry to M13 and one of two different 'conjugation' domains are complimentary to the our protein conjugation modified oligos. By synthesizing our barrel with different sets of adaptor oligos our design allows the creation of two different scaffold diameters and two different conjugation orientations (Figure 4)</p>

This was indicated because of the clear difference between m13 and staple only lanes in comparison to full DNA origami mixed lanes (Figure 7)!!</p>

                                    <p>AFM and EM only let us see our nanostructures when they’re stuck to a surface. Occasionally the surface itself and the AFM tip can also affect the nanostructures’ shape, which may be why our barrels looked slightly flat with AFM. It was important for us to know whether our structures were round barrels in solution. In order for us to obtain this data, we took our nanostructure to the Australian Synchrotron, where we were able to characterise our DNA nanostructures with Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS). </p>
                        <p> By comparing our experimental scattering data with an array of structural models, each with different diameters (Figure 8), we were able to estimate the dimensions of our DNA nanostructure in solution. These were consistent with our design, but the fit to our X-ray scattering data is far from perfect. This could be for several reasons. Firstly, the DNA in solution will not be a static rigid structure like our structural models. Secondly, our sample may not have been 100% pure during our SAXS measurements. Both would flatten the pronounced diffraction bumps compared to those seen in an idealized theoretical scattering pattern (Figure 9).</p>

                        <p>We've designed 2 DNA Scaffolds for assembling the T3SS Needle Tip Complex acording to the specificaitons layed out in our Bioblueprint, and demonstrated that they are of the correct dimentions required, using AFM, EM, and SAXS!! <br>

                                                            <p>Following successful design of the barrel and the tennis racquet we aimed to design new scaffolds that could alleviate other issues with isolating complex protein structures. Two particular methods come to mind, and both were aimed at scaffolding the T3SS tip complex. The first design idea was of a designing a pentagonal tessellating surface, which would create a surface with which many tips could form on one DNA origami scaffold. </p>
                                    <p>Pentagons don't tesselate well in two dimentions! So for our second and perhaps more ambitious design we considered 3D shapes that have some petameric symmetry such as dodecahedrons, which are made of pentagons and have 5 fold symmetry on each face, and icosahedrons which have five fold symmetry around their verticies. We used vHelix to design a DNA icosahedron (Figure 10) that, modified with protein conjugation sites surrounding each vertex, would allow the assembly of 12 T3SS tip complex (Figure 11) for each DNA scaffold.

The most important requirement for DNA origami is the M13 scaffold. Staples were added to M13 template in at 5 – 20 fold molar excess. Final concentration of M13 was either 5 or 10nM The barrel was also made by addition of the common staple mix, alongside any staple extension types we wanted. As shown we had two sides for staple change, with four possible choices (excluding blunt ends). For the HERO barrel (our heavily functionalised barrel) more modifications are required, and thus its ‘recipe’ is changed for annealing. Overall, following mixing, we annealed our barrels with an annealing process in a PCR machine, and visualised the results using agarose gels.</p>

                                    <p>Blunt Staple Barrel - The Blunt Staple Barrel is the barrel without any modifications at all and was made to test the synthesis protocol. 5 μL of M13, Common staples, (Red) Blunt end and (Orange) Blunt ends were added together before the annealing protocol. This was used in structural study via Small Angle X-Ray Scattering.</p>

                                    <p>Non-Hero Barrel - Non-Hero Barrel was made only with conjugation sites in mind. Considered our mid-range barrel, it was utilised mostly in attaching Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) to test conjugation via Microscopy. You can check this out here! 5 μL of M13, Common staples, (Purple) beta barrel direct staples and (Red) blunt ends were mixed. Utilising other staple mixes in place for both sides will change the type and side of the extensions. These also depend on the particular position of the strand binding to these extended staples. 5’ or 3’ modified DNA will change the binding type. Please refer above!</p>

                                    <p>Hero Barrel - The Hero barrel is our most modified scaffold for the tip complex! It has both sides for staple extensions, four sites for fluorescent modified strands and two sites biotinylated strands. (refer to figure 4). New COMMON staple mixes were made but with adapter strands to account for the 6 extended strands situated on the walls, not at the ends. These particular strands that were taken out of the common staple mix and made again are the following wells: Plate 1: B12, B10, F7 and Plate 2: E1, E9, G7. These were replaced with the 6 ordered strands (each with two thymine base pairs and then a twenty base pair extension for adapting to modified strands). The staple mix was then made into aliquots as in 2.2.3. Following addition of 1 to 1 addition of each barrel constituent, modified strands were added. Excess 5’ Tris Aminated DNA was added to bind to staple extended strands (Purple).</p>
