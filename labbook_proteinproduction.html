Samples from different stages of our protein expression and Imobilised Metal Ion Chromatography (IMAC) purification pipeline  were collected for running SDS-PAGE (Figures 2 and 3). The major band corresponded to the expected molecular weights (SipD and LcrV: 39kDa) along with minor bands from contaminants. Protein content of the elutions was quantified by Direct Detect (Millipore) Infrared spectroscopy (SipD: 2.0mg/mL, LcrV: ~12mg/mL).</p>

                       <p>A gBLOCK sequence was ordered from IDT for a LcrV and SipD mutant with an accessible cysteine at the carboxyl terminal. The Gibson assembly reaction and protein expression was successful for the LcrV mutant, but cloning was not successful for the SipD mutant. 
After expressing the LcrV protein, the C-terminal cysteine was labelled with a maleimide Alexa488 fluorophore dye for the purpose of single molecule fluorescence microscopy. Figure 6 is a chromatogram which illustrates our mono-dispersed Alexa488 labelled LcrV protein being eluted at ~15ml.  Figure 7 is a SDS-PAGE gel of our LcrV mutantsâ post-SEC and it protein concentration was determined to be ~ 0.025g.  Figure 8 illustrates the same gel being excited at the wavelength of 495nm to observe the presence of Alexa488 fluorophore dye labelled LcrV proteins. </p>

<h3>2.	Protein Expression</h3>

<p>After we have successfully made our genetic constructs, these can be cloned into T7 <i> E. coli </i> bacteria so they can mass produce our proteins!</p>

<h6>2.1.	Plasmid Purification</h6>

<p>A single positive colony from 1.4 was inoculated into 10ml of LB media and incubated at 37 Â°C overnight. On the following day, once the OD600nm of the culture has reached ~ 1 plasmid DNA purification was performed using the QIAGENÂ® Plasmid Purification kit.<p>

<h6>2.2.	Protein expression in T7 <i> E. coli </i> bacterial culture</h6>

<p>2Âµl of the purified plasmid (section 2.1) was transformed into 25Âµl of T7 high expression <i> E. coli </i> cells via heat shocking at 42Â°C for 45 seconds. 100 Âµl of NEB SOC Outgrowth medium was added to the transformed cells and incubated at 37 Â°C for approximately an hour. The transformed T7 cells were spread onto Luria Broth (LB) agar containing kanamycin (final concentration of 37Âµg/ Âµl) and incubated at 37Â°C overnight.</p>
<h6>2.3.	Starter Culture</h6>
<p>A starter culture was created by inoculating a single colony of T7 <i> E. coli </i> into 20ml of LB media with kanamycin (final concentration of 37Âµg/ Âµl). This starter culture was incubated at 37Â°C until it reached an OD600 > 1. </p>

<h6>2.4.	Large Scale Protein Production </h6>
<p>12 x 1 Litre of LB media was prepared: each litre contains 1 drop of antifoam and a final concentration of 37 Âµg/ Âµl Kanamycin. 1ml of the starter culture (section 2.3) was inoculated per litre of LB media and incubated (37Â°C, 150rpm); the OD600nm was measured every hour until it reached mid-log phase (0.4-0.6). </p>
<p>Once the cultures has reached mid-log phase, a sample was collected for SDS-PAGE. IPTG was added (0.5mM final concentration) to the culture to induce gene expression and incubated (18Â°C, 150rpm) overnight. </p>


<h6>2.5.	Protein Harvest</h6>

<p>On the following day, the OD600nm of the induced cultures were recorded and a sample was collected for SDS-PAGE. The cultures undergone centrifugation (4000g, 20minutes) to pellet the cells and the supernatant was removed. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1ml of lysis buffer (table 2.5.1) per OD 600nm per 100ml of culture.</p> 

<p>For example:</p>
<li>	Volume of bacterial culture grow up: 12 Litres</li>
<li>	OD 600nm of induced culture: 1.6</li>

<p>To obtain the cell lysates, the resuspended mixture was sonicated on the Branson Digital Sonifier using the following settings: 10 minutes at 20% amplitude, 1 second on and 1 second off. 
The cell lysates were ultracentrifuged (13,000g, 30 minutes) to attain the soluble fraction which was then decanted into 15ml falcon tubes. A sample of the cell lysate and soluble fraction was collected for SDS-PAGE.</p>

<h6>3.	Protein Purification</h6>
<p>After we have extracted our protein from the bacteria, we now have to purify it! We aim to do this using histidine tag affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography</p>

<h6>3.1.	Histidine tag affinity chromatography </h6>
<p>1ml Profinity TM IMAC Ni-Charged resin was transferred into a gravity column; the resin and column was washed with three column volumes of MiliQ water and equilibrated with three column volumes of Wash Buffer (table 3.1.1). After the equilibration step, the soluble fraction was transferred into the gravity column and incubated on a slow rotor for ~2 hours at 4Â°C. Once the incubation step has completed, unbounded material was collected in the flow through and washed with three column volumes of Wash Buffer. Samples of unbounded and washed material were collected for SDS-PAGE.</p>

<p>The proteins were subsequently eluted with three column volumes of the elution buffer (table 3.1.2) and samples were also collected for SDS-PAGE. The eluted proteins were concentrated to ~ 2mg/ml via centrifugation (2000g, 5 minutes) in a 10,000 MW membrane concentrator. This concentrated sample will be used for Size Exclusion Chromatography.</p>

Approximately 500Âµl of the concentrated protein (section 3.1) was loaded and purified using the conditions as described in table 3.2.2.</p>

<h6>3.3.	Protein storage</h6>
10% glycerol was added to the pure fractions of the protein and snap-freeze in liquid nitrogen. These samples were stored at -80Â°C and used for the following experiments: bio- layer interferometry, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), atomic force microscopy and electron microscopy.</p>
<h6>3.4.	SDS-PAGE</h6>
<p>Samples collected from the different steps of protein expression and purification were mixed with NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (4X) and loaded onto a NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris gel. Electrophoresis was performed at 200 Volts for 30 minutes. The gel was stained with SimplyBlueTM SafeStain for an hour post electrophoresis and de-stained with MiliQ water overnight. The gel was visualised under visual light</p>


<h3>4.	Protein Labelling</h3>
<h6>4.1.	Alexa488 protein labelling</h6>
<p>400Âµl of 50% slurry of Profinity TM IMAC Ni-Charged resin was equilibrated with 3x3 column volumes of lysis buffer (Table 2.5.1).</p>
<p>Following from the protein harvest (section 2.5) using the LcrV_Cysteine mutants, the equilibrated 50% slurry along with other components were added to the soluble fraction within a 15ml falcon tube as detailed in table 4.1.1. Once added, the soluble were incubated on a slow rotor at 4Â°C for ~2 hours. </p>

<p>After this incubation step, the soluble fraction was transferred into Micro Bio-SpinÂ® Chromatography Columns and washed with 20 column volumes of Wash Buffer (Table 4.1.1) along with five column volumes of rinse buffer (Table 4.1.2). The Ni-charged resin was resuspended to 50% slurry with the rinse buffer and protein concentration was quantified via SDS-PAGE (section 3.3) against known concentrations of BSA. </p>

<p>In an Eppendorf tube, the 50% slurry was incubated with TCEP (200ÂµM) at room temperature for 30 minutes and 5X molar excess of Alexa FluorÂ® 488 dye was added. This mixture was covered in aluminium foil and incubated at 4Â°C overnight. </p>

<h6>4.2.	Labelling purification</h6>

<p>After the incubation, the resin was transferred to a Chromatography Column and washed with 20 column volumes of Wash Buffer (Table 3.1.1) for the removal of unbound excess fluorophores. The labelled proteins were then eluted in 3 x column volume fractions using the elution buffer (Table 3.1.2). </p>

<p>SEC was performed as outlined in section 3.2 to separate remaining excess fluorophore from the labelled protein. Monomeric protein concentration was quantified on SDS-PAGE (section 3.3) against known concentrations of BSA while concentration of labelled protein was determined via UV-visible scan on the NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophometer (1mm path length).</p>

 The labelling efficiency was calculated using the formula:
